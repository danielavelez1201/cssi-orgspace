OrgSpace is a networking and social media platform for organizations that empowers small organizations and allows for powerful collaboration. It features a main feed in which organizations can post about ongoing initiatives or upcoming events, which other organizations can interact with by signing up as collaborators. Individuals and organizations can both comment and donate on posts in order to further support their local organizations. Users can also sign up for events, search for types of organizations, and update their profiles with information about which types of organizations they are part of or are interested in.
